        Hi, my name is Folasade Oloye and I am going to be an incoming junior at San Leandro High School in the fall. I am very active in extracurriculars at my school, such as class board, orchestra, and cooking club! I love traveling! Iâ€™ve been to 5 continents and I hope to visit Peru in South America soon to make it 6.

        <p>
        <strong>Fun Fact: </strong> I am the secretary for the Key Club at my school. Key Club International is student run service club that focuses on teaching leadership by helping others. As secretary I manage files for the club, take notes at every meeting, and send in a monthly report form to the district every 1st.

        I am in an academy at my school called SLAM, San Leandro Academy for Multimedia. In this academy we learn things such as video production, animation, photography, and more. At San Leandro High, we have a two month long period called <em>Season of Service/Period of Peace</em>. During this period clubs, organizations, and classes choose a topic to focus on and do something about it. At SLAM since we are an academy for multimedia, we make a video on a topic we want to spread awareness about. My group decided to make a video on body shaming, and interview people about it.
